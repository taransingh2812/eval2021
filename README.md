# eval2021

Hello viewers,
I have built this small project using many languages such as JavaScript, JSON, AJAX, PHP, while using basic HTML/css.

Aim: This project renders a form look alike page which asks for the receiver's address and the amount of bitcoin test coins to send.
It also has a link to another page, where all the created wallets with name, address and their other transactions information including balance etc.

Doing this project was a great chance for me to learn a new technology as 
I am always excited to learn something new and build something that really helps others. 
Despite having less knowledge of working with APIs, taking a full day, I first learnt the procedure and how to implement them in my code. 
That's what I did here. I used what I learnt in thats short span of time and created Bitcoin Test Wallet, which can be used to transfer BTC Test3 
coins to another provided address. With minor tweeks, the code can be fully optimized. In this process, I learnt to deal with endless status code errors and fixing them as well to make it easier for the user to use it.

The provided address is first validated using BlockCypher API then stored by the timestamp in the SQL Database.
Also, sql has been used at backend to store the entries where the coins get sent to including their hash value.
